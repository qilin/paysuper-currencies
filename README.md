## Developing

### Branches

We use the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) as a branching model for Git.

### Start the application

Application can be started in two modes:

* **microservice** - to maintain rates requests from other components of the PaySuper system. This mode does not request any rates. To run application as microservice don't pass any flags to a command line.
* **console mode** - to retrieve new rates from a source that has been passed as a command-line argument. The console mode can be used with a cron schedule.

To start an application in a console mode you need to set a `-source` flag in a command line with one of the following values:

* `oxr` - to get the rates from openexchangerates.org.
* `centralbanks` - to get the rates from central banks (currently from cbr.ru and ecb.europa.eu).
* `stock` - to calculate the stock rates.

This is an example of a command that runs rates requests from openexchangerates.org and at the end exits the application:

```bash
paysuper-currencies.exe -source=oxr
```

## Correction rules

For a rate may be applied correction rules. The correction rules apply at the moment of a rate or exchange request processing.

The correction rules can be defined for:
* a combination of RateType, ExchangeDirection, Merchant,
* optionally, for some currencies' pair (or for all pairs by default).

The system correction can be defined for:
* a combination of RateType, ExchangeDirection,
* optionally, some currencies' pair (or for all pairs by default).

## Exchange directions

There are two directions for exchange and rates requests: `buy` and `sell`. The direction affects the application of the correction rules for rates and exchanges.

* Exchange direction `buy` increases an exchange rate for a per cent determined in the corresponding correction rule and decreases a result amount.
* Exchange direction `sell` decreases an exchange rate for a per cent determined in the corresponding correction rule and increases a result amount.

### Storing

Example of a currency rate stored in the PaySuper database:

```
{
  "_id": "5cc7030b68add4454016232d",
  "created_at": "2019-04-29T13:58:35.921Z",
  "create_date": "2019-04-29",
  "pair": "USDRUB",
  "rate": 64.679270801,
  "source": "OXR",
  "volume": 1
}
```

Attribute|Description

`_id`|The ID of a record.
`created_at`|The datetime of saving a currency rate to the PaySuper database.
`create_date`|The date of save currency rate to the PaySuper database. It's used for a fast grouping rates to get the first, the last, min and max values by days.
`pair`|The currency's pair.
`rate`|The currency's pair rate.
`source`|The code of a rates source.
`volume`|The volume of exchanges that has been made for this rate. Optional. Default value equals to 0.
